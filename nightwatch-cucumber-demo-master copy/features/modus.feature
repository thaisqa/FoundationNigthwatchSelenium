Feature: Modus Labs
	To establish that our website has an About Page
	As a user, I want to ensure that our labs page has a link to the GitHub repo

	Scenario: Verify GitHub Button
		Given I open the Modus Create labs page
		# And the title is "Modus Labs by Modus Create"
		# And the title is "Modus Create Labs"
		# Then the GitHub button exists
